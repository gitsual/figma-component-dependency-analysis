I'm thrilled to announce the first release of **Figma Component Dependency Analysis**! 🎉

This project has been a labor of love, designed to help developers and designers alike gain deep insights into their Figma projects. By focusing on component dependencies, this tool not only reveals the intricate web of relationships between components but also guides you in optimizing your design and development workflows.

## 🛠️ What's Inside?

The Figma Component Dependency Analysis tool is packed with features to make your design process smoother and more efficient:

- **Dependency Mapping**: Visualize which components depend on others, from atomic components to those that aggregate multiple dependencies.
- **Usage Tracking**: Identify the most frequently used components across your projects, helping you prioritize them for optimization or development.
- **Development Order Guidance**: Get recommendations on the optimal order for developing components based on their dependencies, ensuring a seamless build process.
- **High-Quality Reports**: Generate detailed and actionable reports that provide clear insights into your component structure, making it easier to communicate with your team.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

As a developer and designer, I've often found it challenging to keep track of how components relate to one another, especially in large-scale projects. This tool was born out of a need to bring clarity to complex Figma files, ensuring that the design system remains robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

## 🙌 What's Next?

This is just the beginning! I envision this tool growing into a fully-fledged plugin, offering even more powerful features and deeper integrations with Figma. Your feedback and contributions will be crucial as we continue to evolve this project.
