# 🚀 Figma Service

Welcome to the documentation for the `figmaService.js` file! This module is an integral part of our project, handling the interaction with the Figma API to fetch data that we use throughout our application. Let's dive into the details! 🌟

## 📝 Overview

The `figmaService.js` module is designed to fetch a Figma file using the Figma API and save the response as a JSON file. It ensures that the fetched data is stored correctly for further processing in our application. The module primarily exports a single function:

- **Function:** `getFigmaFile`
- **Purpose:** Fetch data from the Figma API and save it locally as a JSON file.

## ⚙️ Functions

### `getFigmaFile`

```javascript
async function getFigmaFile() { /* ... */ }
```

#### 📝 Description

The `getFigmaFile` function interacts with the Figma API to retrieve a specific file using the provided `FILE_ID` and `FIGMA_API_TOKEN`. Once the data is fetched, the function saves the response as a JSON file in a specified output directory. If the directory does not exist, it is created automatically.

#### 📦 Parameters

- **None**

#### 🔄 Returns

- **`Promise<Object|null>`**: This function returns a promise that resolves to the JSON object containing the Figma data. If the request fails, it returns `null`.

#### 💻 Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the `getFigmaFile` function:

```javascript
const figmaData = await getFigmaFile();
if (figmaData) {
    console.log("Figma data successfully retrieved.");
} else {
    console.log("Failed to retrieve Figma data.");
}
```

#### ⚠️ Throws

- **`Error`**: If the API request fails or if there is an issue with writing the file, an error is thrown. This ensures that any issues are logged and can be handled appropriately.

## 🛠️ Process Breakdown

Let's break down the process followed by the `getFigmaFile` function:

1. **API Request**: The function initiates a GET request to the Figma API using the provided `FILE_ID` and `FIGMA_API_TOKEN`.
2. **Directory Check**: Before saving the data, the function checks if the output directory exists. If it doesn't, the directory is created.
3. **Save Data**: The response from the Figma API is saved as a JSON file in the specified output directory.
4. **Error Handling**: If any step fails, an error is logged and rethrown to ensure that issues are caught and managed effectively.

## 🚨 Error Handling

The `getFigmaFile` function includes robust error handling to ensure that any issues during the API request or file writing process are properly logged and managed. If an error occurs, it is:

- Logged with a descriptive message.
- Rethrown as a new `Error` with a clear message about what went wrong.

This approach helps in diagnosing problems and maintaining the stability of the application.
